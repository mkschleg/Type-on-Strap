There has been a ton of approaches in artificial intelligence (AI), and plenty of biological and philosophical reasoning to back approaches.


# Symbols, Probabilities, and Logic. Oh My!

# Learning

An important observation, although seemingly obvious in retrospect, is the ability to learn, a topic of research that has grown enormously in recent years. But what do I mean by learning? What can be classified as learning? Well, those are good questions and I would think if you asked all the major researchers you would get a different answer for each. It is a tricky subject, primarily due to our limited understanding of learning in biological machines. Is an amoeba's reaction to chemical gradients in its environment an act of learning? Or does learning require a core ganglia of nerve cells reacting to electrical signals transmitted from prior nerve cells? Even our understanding of how learning occurs in the brain is limited even though humans have been fascinated by the brain for millennia.
