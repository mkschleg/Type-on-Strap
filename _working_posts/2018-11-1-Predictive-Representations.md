So a lot of those who know me know that I am a predictive representation evangelical. Meaning I think predictive representations should be used more often than they have been. But, you might say, doesn't deep learning give use everything we need in terms of function approximation or representation? Given the hype that surrounds the field of deep learning, this opinion is quite popular. I'm not precluding the need for deep learning approaches, but I don't believe they are the end of the problem in learning a good representation.
